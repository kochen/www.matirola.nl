The program of our big day is not yet finalized, but to give you already a small glimpse, the program will roughly look like this:

* `17.00 - 17.15` Welcome at the Centraal Ketelhuis
* `17.15 - 18.30` ‘We do’! Ceremony-time :)
* `18.30 - 19.00` Pie & Bubbles 
* `19.00 - 20.30` Drinks & Pics
* `20.30 - 23.00` Foodie time!

Especially for those who are coming from abroad: the plan is to organise some fun activities for the Friday and Saturday after the wedding so that we have more time to meet up and show you a bit more of our lovely hometown. Come back soon for more information about the plans; and feel free to join whenever you feel like :)
